Recruiters currently spend hours manually reviewing resumes against job descriptions (JDs). This leads to delays, inconsistent evaluations, and high workloads.

Our solution is an AI-powered Resume Relevance Check System that:

Automatically evaluates resumes against job requirements.

Generates a Relevance Score (0â€“100).

Highlights missing skills, certifications, and projects.

Provides a fit verdict (High / Medium / Low).

Suggests improvement feedback for students.

Displays results in a neumorphic dashboard UI with CSV export.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

Resume Parsing â†’ Extracts text from PDF/DOCX.

Job Description Parsing â†’ Identifies required & nice-to-have skills.

Hybrid Analysis Engine

âœ… Hard Match â†’ Keyword & fuzzy skill matching.

ðŸ¤– Semantic Match â†’ Embedding-based similarity (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

Scoring System

Weighted final score = Hard + Semantic.

Verdict thresholds:

High = 75â€“100

Medium = 50â€“74

Low = 0â€“49

Feedback Generator â†’ Suggests missing skills, summary improvements, and project ideas.
